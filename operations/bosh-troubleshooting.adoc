= Bosh basics & troubleshooting

== Goal

To understand the basics of troubleshooting techniques.

== Exercises

=== Ops Manager

Ops Manager is a rails application.  It is installed as a service called `tempest-web`.

==== Ops Manager installation directory

It is important to be aware of the two main directories used by Ops Manager.  You can access these by ssh-ing into the Ops Manager VM.

. Ops Manager is started out of the /home/tempest-web directory.

. Ops Manager uses the /var/tempest directory to store installation components.

==== Restarting Ops Manager

If your Ops Manager application becomes unresponsive, you may need to restart it.

. SSH into the Ops Manager VM

. Restart Ops Mgr:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo service tempest-web stop
$ sudo service tempest-web start
----
+


==== Ops Manager Debug Endpoints

Ops Manager has a `debug` endpoint that can be useful for grabbing overview information.  This can be useful when filing bug reports or troubleshooting.

. Navigate to https://<YOUR_OPS_MGR>/debug

. *files*: contains a yml representation of your installation.

. *component_types*: shows summary of all installed components/tiles and their configuration.

. *rails_log*: shows a recent tail of the logs for the rails application.


=== Bosh Overview

The following overview will be applied throughout the exercises.

. Review the link:http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/understanding-bosh.html[Understanding Bosh] documentation

. Review the link:http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/bosh-components.html[Bosh Components] documentation

. QUESTION: What bosh component is responsible for recreating a failed VM?
  Answer :- Resurrector
. QUESTION: Where did you enable this component in Ops Manager?
  Answer :- 
  Ops Manager Director for vSphere -> Director Config -> Enable VM Resurrector Plugin

==== Using Bosh

. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html[Advanced Troubleshooting]

. Log into your Ops Manager VM via SSH

. From the Ops Manager VM, target & log into the Bosh director

==== Downloading the deployment manifest

In the section on link:backup-pcf.adoc[Backing up PCF], you should have read the step on downloading the deployment manifest.  To demonstrate the basics of targeting the director and logging in, you will download and push a manifest to you project repository.

. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/sysadmin-commands.html[Bosh Commands for System Administration]

. Download the deployment manifest for Jenkins and push it to your class  repository in the `operations` directory.  Name this file `jenkins.yml`.

==== Manifest Basics

. Review the link:http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/jobs.html[Bosh Jobs & Errands] documentation

. QUESTION: What is the name of the stemcell used to create the jenkins master job?

. QUESTION: What errands exist in this manifest?

==== Bosh Troubleshooting

. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/disaster-recovery.html[Disaster Recovery]

. QUESTION: What command would you use to attempt to manually scan the health and possibly recover failed VMs?

==== Bosh Logging

. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/job-logs.html[Bosh Logs]

. Follow the instructions and download the *agent* logs for the cloud controller.

. QUESTION: Assume the above command failed.  Explain what steps you would take to attempt to review the logs.

==== Monit basics

Bosh uses link:http://mmonit.com/monit/[monit] to manage running processes on VMs.  In this exercise, you will ssh to the cloud controller vm and view the running processes.  You must push the result into your project repository as detailed below.

. Follow the directions under *SSH into Ops Manager* on the  link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html[Advanced Troubleshooting] guide.
+
Scroll the bottom of the above page and be sure the follow the instructions under *Bosh SSH*.
+

. Use `bosh ssh` to ssh into the cloud controller.  You may be prompted by the following:
+
* _Enter password (use it to sudo on remote host)_: Whatever you supply here, you can use during your SSH session if you need to sudo as root.  This is a temporary password.  It is common to just use `*`.
* _Enter passphrase for key /home/tempest/.ssh/id_rsa_: This is the password you set when you ran the ssh-keygen command above.

* _bosh_something@192.168.someIP's password_: Enter the sudo password you set above.
+

. Assume root
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo su
----
+

. Navigate to /var/vcap and have a look around.  This is the main directory where bosh installs everything.

. The /var/vcap/bosh/bin directory contains the monit executable.  Export a list of running processes and push this to your repository in the `operations` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit summary > cc_monit_summary.txt
----
+

. *If you needed to*, you could restart a process with `monit restart XXXXX`

. Exit the bosh ssh session and the Ops Manager VM ssh session.
